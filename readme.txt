This is a directory which is used by me to learn git.
Every program written in this folder is also a learning experience of my own.

Hope I enjoy this learning experience.

All hail the God!

For now to learn git I will use Dennis Richie's C book to learn C also.
Yes I am learning git before C or along C
I already know a bit of C though.
